# Create your repo landscape

This instruction will describe the feature and guide you on how to use this repo template to create your own repository landscape.

## Key Features ðŸš€

This repository template provides some features that help you create your repo landscape content automatically:

- Supports defining the list of repositories to be shown in the landscape, file `repository_list.txt`.
- Automated script to generate content from the `repository_list.txt`.
- A CI pipeline to generate new repository landscape content:
  - Triggers the automated generation script.
  - Creates a pull request to propose the new content.
- The repository landscape format provides:
  - Indexing with repo name title
  - Repo URL
  - Repo description
  - A GitHub stars badge

## Quick start ðŸ“–

This is optional; you can skip this section and jump into `Configure and use the template ðŸ“˜` to create your own repo.
If you want to generate the content locally, update the `repository_list.txt` and run this script:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tungbq/repos.git
cd repos
./generate_content.sh repository_list.txt
```

Result will be similar to:

```bash
âžœ  repos git:(main) âœ— ./generate_content.sh repository_list.txt

Now check the README.md and you would find your repository landscape content

## Configure and use the template ðŸ“˜

Below are the steps to help you create and configure your own landscape repository.
<br>
In short we only need to do 4 major steps: `Create new repo from template` > `Set up GITHUB_TOKEN` > `Update repository list` > `Merge the automated PR`.
<br>
Let's dive into the detailed as below:

### 1. Create a new repo from the template

- Visit the template repository: [https://github.com/tungbq/repos](https://github.com/tungbq/repos).
- In the top right corner, select `Use this template` > `Create a new repository`:

  ![create-repo-from-template](./assets/create-repo-from-template.png)

- Input your repository name to create and add a description if needed, then select `Create repository`.

  ![create-repo](./assets/create-repo.png)

- Wait for a few seconds, and your repository will be created.

### 2. Configure `GITHUB_TOKEN` for the new repo

There is a CI workflow to automatically generate content and open a new Pull Request for your repository landscape, so setting up `GITHUB_TOKEN` permission is required.
<br>
Goto: https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO/settings/actions (Repo > Setting > Action > General), in the `Workflow permission` section, enable following options:

- Read and write permissions
- Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests

  ![gh-token-in-repo](./assets/gh-token-in-repo.png)

Now we are ready to trigger the CI workflow to update the repo landscape.

### 3. Update your repository list

- Add your repository list to the file `repository_list.txt` in your repository and merge it into the `main` branch, for example:

```
tungbq/devops-basics
tungbq/AWSHub
tungbq/devops-toolkit
tungbq/devops-project
tungbq/aws-lab-with-terraform
tungbq/awesome-workflow
```

### 4. Configure the content mode`

- NOTE: This step is OPTIONAL, by default we will generate content in `table` format. Skip this step to use the default mode
- If you want to use th list format, udpate the `content_mode` variable in workflow file `.github/workflows/generate_content.yaml` to `list`:
  ```yaml
  # File: .github/workflows/generate_content.yaml
  env:
    # Current supported mode: 'table' and 'list'
    content_mode: 'table'
  ```

### 5. Trigger the CI pipeline

#### Automatically trigger on merge event to main

- Once the `repository_list.txt` is merged into the `main` branch, the CI pipeline Update content will be triggered automatically.

  ![ci-main-trigger](./assets/ci-main-trigger.png)

- The CI pipeline will read the repository list and generate your new `README.md` content.
- Then, it will check and create a Pull Request to propose the new repository landscape content.

  ![pr-automated](./assets/pr-automated.png)

#### Manual trigger (Optional)

- You can also trigger that CI at any moment you want.
- Go to Actions and select Update content.
- Select "Run workflow" to trigger the CI:

  ![action-run](./assets/action-run.png)

### 6. Review and merge the PR

Once the PR is raised automatically, you just need to review and merge, and that's it! You will have your own landscape content in README.md.

![pr-merge](./assets/pr-merge.png)

Congratulations ðŸŽ‰, you've successfully created your own repo landscape! Now check the `README.md` for the final result.

## Advance CI configuration (Optional)

- In the previous section, we triggered the CI pipeline to run on a merge event to `main` branch or manual event. You could improve that by changing the trigger event to run on a timer basis. For example, once a week or once a month. This would help us regularly check and update the landscape, keeping it up to date.
- To do so, add your desired cron trigger to `repos/.github/workflows/generate_content.yaml`

```yaml
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * 6' # Run every Saturday at midnight
  workflow_dispatch:
  # other events as needed
```

- Check https://crontab.guru/ for the CRON syntax
