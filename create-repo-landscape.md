# Create your repo landscape

This instruction will describe the feature and guide you on how to use this repo template to create your own repository landscape.

## Key Features ðŸš€

This repository template provides some features that help you create your repo landscape content automatically:

- Supports defining the list of repositories to be shown in the landscape, file `repository_list.txt`.
- Automated script to generate content from the `repository_list.txt`.
- A CI pipeline to generate new repository landscape content:
  - Triggers the automated generation script.
  - Creates a pull request to propose the new content.
- The repository landscape format provides:
  - Indexing with repo name title
  - Repo URL
  - Repo description
  - A GitHub stars badge

## Quick start ðŸ“–

This is optional; you can skip this section and jump into `Configure and use the template ðŸ“˜` to create your own repo.
If you want to generate the content locally, update the `repository_list.txt` and run this script:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tungbq/repos.git
cd repos
./generate_content.sh repository_list.txt
```

Result will be similar to:

```bash
âžœ  repos git:(main) âœ— ./generate_content.sh repository_list.txt

Now check the README.md and you would find your repository landscape content

## Configure and use the template ðŸ“˜

Below are the steps to help you create and configure your own landscape repository.
<br>
In short we only need to do 4 major steps: `Create new repo from template` > `Set up PAT` > `Update repository list` > `Merge the automated PR`.
<br>
Let's dive into the detailed as below:

### 1. Create a new repo from the template

- Visit the template repository: [https://github.com/tungbq/repos](https://github.com/tungbq/repos).
- In the top right corner, select `Use this template` > `Create a new repository`:

  ![create-repo-from-template](./assets/create-repo-from-template.png)

- Input your repository name to create and add a description if needed, then select `Create repository`.

  ![create-repo](./assets/create-repo.png)

- Wait for a few seconds, and your repository will be created.

### 2. Configure Personal Access Token (PAT) for the new repo

There is a CI workflow to automatically generate content and open a new Pull Request for your repository landscape, so setting up a PAT is required.

#### 2.1. Generate the token

- Click on your profile in the top right corner > `Settings` > `Developer settings`, or visit: [https://github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens).
- Select `Generate new token`.

  ![pat-generate](./assets/pat-generate.png)

- Set the expiration date (my personal choice is 90 days; you can set it to whatever you want).
- Select only the `repo` scope for better security.

  ![pat-setup](./assets/pat-setup.png)

- Then click `Generate token`.
- Finally, copy or note the newly created token somewhere for later use.

#### 2.2. Create the PAT token variable

- Go to `Settings` > `Secrets and variables` > `Actions`
- Visit: https://github.com/<your_username>/<your_new_reponame>/settings/secrets/actions
- In the `New repository secrets` section, input the PAT as the name and the token.

  ![secret-action-create](./assets/secret-action-create.png)

- Once completed, you will see a result similar to this:

  ![secret-completed](./assets/secret-completed.png)

Now we are ready to trigger the CI workflow to update the repo landscape.

### 3. Update your repository list

- Add your repository list to the file `repository_list.txt` in your repository and merge it into the `main` branch, for example:

```
tungbq/devops-basics
tungbq/AWSHub
tungbq/devops-toolkit
tungbq/devops-project
tungbq/aws-lab-with-terraform
tungbq/awesome-workflow
```

### 4. Trigger the CI pipeline

#### Automatically trigger on merge event to main

- Once the `repository_list.txt` is merged into the `main` branch, the CI pipeline Update content will be triggered automatically.

  ![ci-main-trigger](./assets/ci-main-trigger.png)

- The CI pipeline will read the repository list and generate your new `README.md` content.
- Then, it will check and create a Pull Request to propose the new repository landscape content.

  ![pr-automated](./assets/pr-automated.png)

#### Manual trigger (Optional)

- You can also trigger that CI at any moment you want.
- Go to Actions and select Update content.
- Select "Run workflow" to trigger the CI:

  ![action-run](./assets/action-run.png)

### 5. Review and merge the PR

Once the PR is raised automatically, you just need to review and merge, and that's it! You will have your own landscape content in README.md.

![pr-merge](./assets/pr-merge.png)

Congratulations ðŸŽ‰, you've successfully created your own repo landscape! Now check the `README.md` for the final result.

## Advance CI configuration (Optional)

- In the previous section, we triggered the CI pipeline to run on a merge event to `main` branch or manual event. You could improve that by changing the trigger event to run on a timer basis. For example, once a week or once a month. This would help us regularly check and update the landscape, keeping it up to date.
- To do so, add your desired cron trigger to `repos/.github/workflows/generate_content.yaml`

```yaml
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * 6' # Run every Saturday at midnight
  workflow_dispatch:
  # other events as needed
```

- Check https://crontab.guru/ for the CRON syntax
