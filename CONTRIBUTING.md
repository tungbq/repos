# Contributing

The following information provides a set of guidelines for contributing to the **tungbq/repos** chain main repo. Use your best judgment, and, if you see room for improvement, please propose changes to this document.

## First steps

The first step is to find an issue you want to fix. To identify issues we think are good for first-time contributors, we add the **good first issue** label.
Once you find an existing issue that you want to work on or if you have a new issue to create, continue below.

## Proposing changes

To contribute a change proposal, use the following workflow:

1. [Fork the repository](https://github.com/tungbq/repos).
2. If you find this repository helpful, kindly consider showing your appreciation by giving it a star ⭐ Thanks! 💖
3. [Add an upstream](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork) so that you can update your fork.
4. Clone your fork to your computer.
5. Create a branch and name it appropriately.
6. Work on only one major change in one pull request.
7. Make sure all tests are passing locally.
8. Next, rinse and repeat the following:

    1. Commit your changes. Write a simple, straightforward commit message. To learn more, see [How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).
    2. Push your changes to your remote fork. To add your remote, you can copy/paste the following:

    ```sh

    #Remove origin

    git remote remove origin

    #set a new remote

    git remote add my_awesome_new_remote_repo [insert-link-found-in-source-subtab-of-your-repo]

    #Verify new remote

    git remote -v

    > my_awesome_new_remote_repo  [link-found-in-source-subtab-of-your-repo] (fetch)
    > my_awesome_new_remote_repo  [link-found-in-source-subtab-of-your-repo] (push)

    #Push changes to your remote repo

    git push <your_remote_name>

    #e.g. git push my_awesome_new_remote_repo
    ```

    3. Create a PR on the **tungbq/repos** repository. There should be a PR template to help you do so.
    4. Wait for your changes to be reviewed. If you are a maintainer, you can assign your PR to one or more reviewers. If you aren't a maintainer, one of the maintainers will assign a reviewer.
    5. After you receive feedback from a reviewer, make the requested changes, commit them to your branch, and push them to your remote fork again.
    6. Once approval is given, feel free to squash & merge!
